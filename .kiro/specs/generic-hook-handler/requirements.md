# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will refactor the existing hook system from a specific handler-based architecture to a generic handler that can process any hook event type. The generic handler will accept a target hook event name, stdin data, and a callback function, then process the JSON input and execute the callback only when the target event matches the event in the data. This will make the system more flexible and reusable for different hook event types.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a generic hook handler function that can process any hook event type, so that I can reuse the same processing logic across different event handlers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the generic handler is called with a target hook_event_name, stdin, and callback THEN the system SHALL parse the JSON from stdin
2. WHEN the JSON is successfully parsed THEN the system SHALL extract the hook_event_name from the data
3. WHEN the extracted hook_event_name matches the target hook_event_name THEN the system SHALL call the provided callback function with the data
4. WHEN the extracted hook_event_name does not match the target hook_event_name THEN the system SHALL not call the callback function
5. WHEN the processing is complete THEN the system SHALL return the parsed data dictionary

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the generic handler to handle JSON parsing errors gracefully, so that the system remains stable when invalid input is provided.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid JSON is provided in stdin THEN the system SHALL raise an appropriate exception with a clear error message
2. WHEN stdin is empty or not available THEN the system SHALL raise an exception indicating no input data was provided
3. WHEN the parsed JSON is not a dictionary THEN the system SHALL raise an exception indicating the expected format
4. WHEN hook_event_name is missing from the data THEN the system SHALL handle this gracefully and not call the callback

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the existing handler functions to be easily adaptable to use the new generic handler, so that I can migrate the current system without major rewrites.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating existing handlers THEN each handler SHALL be able to use the generic handler with minimal code changes
2. WHEN using the generic handler THEN the callback function SHALL receive the same data structure as the current handlers
3. WHEN the generic handler is used THEN it SHALL maintain the same return value semantics as the current system
4. WHEN integrating with existing code THEN the generic handler SHALL not break the current logging or error handling patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the generic handler to be type-safe and well-documented, so that it's easy to understand and use correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining the generic handler THEN it SHALL include proper type hints for all parameters and return values
2. WHEN documenting the generic handler THEN it SHALL include clear docstrings explaining the purpose and usage
3. WHEN using the generic handler THEN the callback parameter SHALL be properly typed as a callable
4. WHEN the function is called THEN it SHALL validate that required parameters are provided

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the generic handler to be testable in isolation, so that I can verify its behavior without depending on the specific hook implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing the generic handler THEN it SHALL be possible to test with mock stdin input
2. WHEN testing callback execution THEN it SHALL be possible to verify the callback was called with correct parameters
3. WHEN testing event filtering THEN it SHALL be possible to verify callbacks are only called for matching events
4. WHEN testing error conditions THEN it SHALL be possible to verify proper exception handling
