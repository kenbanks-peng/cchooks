# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Python library that provides a simple, unified entry point for external Python code to interact with Claude's code hook system. The library will abstract the complexity of the Claude code hook specification and provide a clean API for registering and handling hook events. The primary goal is to enable developers to easily integrate hook functionality into their applications with minimal boilerplate code.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Python developer, I want to import a simple hook function from a library, so that I can easily integrate Claude hook functionality into my application without understanding the underlying hook specification details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I import the library THEN I SHALL be able to access a hook function with a simple import statement like `from cchooks import hook`
2. WHEN I call the hook function THEN it SHALL accept three parameters: hook_event_name (string), stdin (dictionary), and callback (function)
3. WHEN the hook function is called THEN it SHALL return the processed data from the callback execution
4. IF the import fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating missing dependencies or installation issues

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer integrating hook functionality, I want the library to handle the Claude code hook specification internally, so that I don't need to understand the complex hook protocol details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide a hook_event_name THEN the library SHALL validate it against supported Claude hook events
2. WHEN I provide stdin data THEN the library SHALL properly format and process it according to the Claude hook specification
3. WHEN the hook is triggered THEN the library SHALL handle all protocol-specific communication with Claude
4. IF an unsupported hook_event_name is provided THEN the system SHALL raise a clear error with supported event types
5. IF stdin data is malformed THEN the system SHALL validate and provide descriptive error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to provide a callback function that gets executed when the hook event occurs, so that I can define custom logic for handling different hook events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide a callback function THEN it SHALL be called with the processed hook data as parameters
2. WHEN the callback executes successfully THEN the hook function SHALL return the callback's return value
3. WHEN the callback raises an exception THEN the library SHALL handle it gracefully and provide error context
4. IF no callback is provided THEN the system SHALL raise a clear error indicating the callback is required
5. IF the callback is not callable THEN the system SHALL validate and raise an appropriate error

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the library to support all standard Claude hook events, so that I can handle different types of hook interactions in my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I specify "stop" as hook_event_name THEN the library SHALL handle stop event processing
2. WHEN I specify other standard Claude hook events THEN the library SHALL support them according to the Claude hook specification
3. WHEN hook events are processed THEN the library SHALL maintain compatibility with the Claude code hook spec
4. IF a hook event requires specific data formats THEN the library SHALL validate and transform the data appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear error handling and logging, so that I can debug issues when integrating the hook library into my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur during hook processing THEN the library SHALL provide descriptive error messages
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL indicate exactly what validation rule was violated
3. WHEN the library encounters internal errors THEN it SHALL log appropriate debug information
4. IF the Claude hook specification is not met THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on how to fix the issue
5. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the library SHALL support optional verbose logging modes
